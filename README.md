# Minting-NFT

This contract provides a basic functionality about creating a token, management and tracking of balance.
1. Token Name : "PUSH" is the token name(tokenName). And "PULL" is the token abbreviation(tokenAbbvr.
2. Total Supply : Initial total supply (totalSupply) is set 0.
3. Balances mapping : A mapping called as "balances" is maintained in the contract, that tracks the token balances of different addresses.
4. Minting Tokens : The function "mint" allows to create new tokens and assigns them to a specified address. It upadates the balance address and increase the total supply.
5. Burning Tokens : The function "burn" enables the destruction of existing tokens held by a specific address. It reduces the total supply and updates the balance of thr address, but only if the address, but only if the address has suficient tokens.

## Description

The "MyToken" contract is a simple implementation of a token on the Ethereum Blockchain. It allows for the token creating(minting)
and destruction(burning) by manipulating the total supply and individual balances. It provides a basic foundation for building token
related functionalities on Ethereum.
